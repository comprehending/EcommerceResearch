# EcommerceResearch

Our task is to analyze the assortment of an online HomeGoods store.
The analysis is performed for the product managers of the store.
As for the product range analysis, managers of the store are most concerned about the following things:
Which products are more often sold by themselves, and which ones are more often combined with others (main and additional assortment)?
What product groups are more often included in the additional assortment?
What bundles of product groups are often present in shopping carts? For example, the category "houseplants" can often be accompanied by "mineral fertilizers"
The store has provided a file with the history of transactions.
